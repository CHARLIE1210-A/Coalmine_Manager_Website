# Coal Mining Project - Smart India Hackathon

Our project, developed for the Smart India Hackathon under the Railway Ministry, aims to revolutionize the coal mining industry by leveraging modern web technologies and APIs to enhance operational efficiency and safety. Utilizing a stack of React, Express, MySQL, and a messaging API, we created a robust and scalable solution tailored to the unique needs of coal mining operations.

## Key Features

1. **Real-Time Data Monitoring**
   - Our system continuously monitors various parameters within the mining environment, ensuring real-time visibility and data-driven decision-making.

2. **Efficient Data Management**
   - With MySQL as our database, we efficiently store and manage extensive data sets related to mining operations, equipment status, and worker safety.

3. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - The front-end, built with React, provides an intuitive and responsive interface for users to interact with the system, view real-time data, and generate reports.

4. **Scalable and Secure Backend**
   - The Express framework powers our backend, offering a scalable and secure environment for handling data processing and API requests.

5. **Enhanced Communication**
   - Integration with a messaging API ensures seamless communication between various stakeholders, including on-ground workers and management teams, thereby improving coordination and response times in critical situations.

6. **Safety and Compliance**
   - Our solution includes features to monitor and ensure compliance with safety regulations, minimizing the risk of accidents and enhancing worker safety.

Through this project, we aim to demonstrate how technology can be harnessed to transform traditional industries like coal mining, making them safer, more efficient, and more sustainable.
